          <h3>Friend One</h3>
          <p>I first met Courtney in my first year of middle school in my English room. She was so warm and kind that I
            felt honored to speak to such a nice angel. Courtney became my first true friend that I could ever count on.
            She was always there in a heartbeat when I needed her wise words of wisdom.</p>
